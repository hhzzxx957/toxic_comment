# Toxic comment analysis I
In this project, I implemented the Long-short-term-memory (LSTM) Neural network to analysis half million Wikipedia comments' toxicity, which was originaly raised up by Jigsaw and Google through this kaggle competition:

## 2. Examples about Ensemble modeling
Here are the example codes used in the kaggle competition, input files are not included.
### (1) Out-of-fold (OOF) stacking

### (2) Geomean and wighted average

## 3. A simple website to test comment's toxicity
http://hzx957.pythonanywhere.com/  
This is a test website built by python Flask, the toxicity prediction is based on the pretrained LSTM model. All source codes about the website is included in the websitecode folder.

# Toxic comment analysis II
To solve the identity bias problem, Jigsaw and Google proposed another competition on Kaggle in 2019, the number of comments has increased to 2 million.

In this project, I used state-of-art NLP technique BERT to analysis Wikipedia comments' toxicity.
